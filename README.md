# Home_Sales
module 22 challenge

# Challenge Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to practice SparkSQL techniques to answer questions about home sales data. Spark was used to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached. The following questions about the home_sales data were answered:

  1.) What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

  2.) What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

  3.) What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

  4.) What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
